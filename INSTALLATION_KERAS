INSTALLATION OF KERAS (on the day keras 2.0 was availble)
===========================================================
NOTE: we need python and opencv installed.

  STEP 1:  INSTALLING KERAS   
  ==========================
    METHOD 1:
    ==============
        Installation using PYPI(i.e. using pip)
        .......................................
            sudo pip install keras      # If you are about to install in virtualenvironment, you may want to avoid using sudo

    METHOD 2:
    ==============
        Installation using setup file(i.e. clone from github)
        #navigte to the path you want to put your keras files
        .....................................................
            git clone https://github.com/fchollet/keras.git
            cd keras
            sudo python setup.py install
        

  STEP 2:  SWITCHING KERAS BACKEND(THEANO or TENSORFLOW)   
  ================================
    
    BACKENDS
    ==============
        Keras uses three backends
            1. Tensorflow
            2. Theano
            3. CNTK
        
           TensorFlow is an open-source symbolic tensor manipulation framework developed by Google.
           Theano is an open-source symbolic tensor manipulation framework developed by LISA Lab at Université de Montréal.
           CNTK is an open-source toolkit for deep learning developed by Microsoft.
        
    After installing keras, when we tried to import keras using python it won't import
    (if we haven't installed tensorfow previously).
     
    you have find the locasion of .keras folder which contain "keras.json". we will change the keyword for backend row.
          
        
        Using TensorFlow as backend
        ...........................
          In order to use tensorflow, we need minimum opencv 3.0 or higher verion of opencv. dont worry about for python version,
          both python 2.7 and python 3 or higher versions support tensorflow.
          
          To install TensorFlow, check this out https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux
          
          step 1: open "keras.json" file
          step 2: change the backend as "tensorflow"
          step 3: save the file


        Using Theano as backend
        ...........................
          Theano is directly available. we dont need to install theano.
          
          step 1: open "keras.json" file
          step 2: change the backend as "theano"
          step 3: save the file
          
          
   Finaly, import keras in python depending on your backend, python will import keras. 
   If you dont get any errors, you have installed keras successfully.
